# UART Communication Protocol Simulation
 
 # Overview

This project is a sample program designed to demonstrate the structure and implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication protocol in an embedded systems environment. It provides a functional example of how to handle UART initialization, data transmission, reception, and error handling. The code is written in C and designed to run on ARM-based architectures using arm-none-eabi-gcc.

The program serves as a learning tool for understanding the fundamental concepts of UART communication, including managing hardware registers, configuring the UART protocol, and handling errors effectively.

 # Key Features

1) UART Initialization

Configures UART settings, such as baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity.
Simulates user-defined configuration for a real-world UART setup.

2) Data Transmission

Implements a function to send a single character over UART.
Allows transmission of strings with efficient looping and FIFO management.

3) Data Reception

Demonstrates interrupt-driven data reception using a circular buffer.
Ensures reliable data handling without loss during high-speed communication.

4) Error Detection and Handling

Identifies and reports common UART errors such as:

    Overrun Error (OERR)
    Framing Error (FERR)
    Parity Error (PERR)
    Break Error (BER)

Provides mechanisms to clear error flags and maintain communication integrity.

5) Interrupt Management

Uses simulated RX (Receive) interrupts to demonstrate efficient data reception.
Highlights how to clear interrupt flags and handle buffer overflow conditions.

 # Learning Objectives

This project is aimed at developers and students who want to:

Understand how UART works in embedded systems.
Learn how to interact with hardware registers in a low-level programming context.
Explore methods for handling asynchronous communication errors.
Gain insights into interrupt-driven programming for efficient data handling.

 # How It Works

**Configuration:**

The program initializes the UART module with user-defined parameters such as baud rate, parity, and buffer size.

**Data Flow:**

1) Transmission: Characters or strings are written to the UART Data Register (UARTDR).
2) Reception: Data received via UART is stored in a circular buffer using RX interrupts for efficient management.
3) Error Management:

During reception, the program checks the UART Receive Status Register (UARTRSR) for errors and handles them appropriately, ensuring the system remains operational.

 # Use Case

This project is structured as a template program to demonstrate how to build a robust UART communication protocol. It can be used as a starting point for more advanced projects, such as:

1) Building UART-based communication systems for microcontrollers.
2) Developing interrupt-driven data transfer mechanisms.
3) Understanding the foundations of kernel-level UART management.

 # System Requirements

Toolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc
Simulator: QEMU or ARM-based embedded hardware
Target Architecture: ARM Cortex or similar


# **Disclaimer**

This is a sample program intended for educational purposes. While it simulates UART functionality effectively, real-world implementation may require adaptation to specific hardware platforms. Ensure proper hardware configurations when deploying on physical systems.
